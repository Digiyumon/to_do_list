## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I learned a lot about the overall structure of Flutter and how exactly widgets work. 
Specifically, finding what attributes each widget has, like children, color and padding. 
Understanding the key differences between using a stateless or a stateful widget, and when is the best time to use each one. 
Lastly, I learned about saving user preferences using the shared_preferences API that flutter contains.
